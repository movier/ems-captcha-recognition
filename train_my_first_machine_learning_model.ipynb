    "# Train My First Machine Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm always interested in machine learning since last year I learned the concept. After watched a lot of videos and read a bunch of posts, recently I trained my first machine learning model and it's really exciting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first also the most important thing to train a model is to find a problem which is currently handled by human but could be solved by machine. If you are one of the human it will be great because you will be willing to save yourself a lot of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use [EMS](http://ems.com.cn)(Express Mail Service) a lot after my baby was born because I need to query milk powder from Germany(*Big thanks to my best friend in Germany*) and commodities from Amazon Japan."
